<h3>First, I introduce myself...</h3>
&nbsp People call me by my first name Lohan,<br>
&nbsp I'm living in North French (Nord d√©partement)<br>
&nbsp So I'm a french young guy who love web development.<br>
&nbsp <sup><i>I'm not a professional but I aspire to become one.</i></sup>
<h3>Why I'm on GitHub ?</h3>
&nbsp <sub><i>Why not ?</i></sub><br>
&nbsp More seriously, in order to share some of my projects with people,<br>
&nbsp and if some French recruiters pass through there and love my work,<br>
&nbsp <sup><i>You can write me at : <a href="mailto:dancuo.lohan@gmail.com">dancuo.lohan@gmail.com</a></i></sup>
